## PREDICTIVE MODELLING FOR NETWORK THREAT DETECTION USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES
AI algorithms analyze extensive network traffic data to identify patterns of potential threats like malware and anomalies. Predictive models can forecast vulnerabilities and detect emerging threats before they lead to security breaches.

## About
By analysing vastamounts of network traffic data, AI algorithms can identify patterns indicative of potential threats, including malware, intrusions, and anomalous activities. The predictive models developed through this approach can forecast potential network vulnerabilities and pre-emptively detect emerging threats before they manifest into security breaches. This proactive stance empowers organizations to fortify their network defences, minimize the risk of cyberattacks, and safeguard sensitive information.
